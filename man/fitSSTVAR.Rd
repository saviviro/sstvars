\description{
\code{fitSSTVAR} uses a robust method and a variable metric algorithm to estimate
  a structural STVAR model based on preliminary estimates from a reduced form model.
}
\details{
When the structural model does not impose overidentifying constraints, it is directly
  obtained from the reduced form model, and estimation is not required. When overidentifying constraints
  are imposed, the model is estimated subject to the constraints.

  Using the robust estimation method before switching to the variable metric can be useful if the initial
  estimates are not very close to the ML estimate of the structural model, as the variable metric algorithm
  (usually) converges to a nearby local maximum or saddle point. However, if the initial estimates are far from
  the ML estimate, the resulting solution is likely local only due to the complexity of the model. Note that
  Nelder-Mead algorithm is much faster than SANN but can get stuck at a local solution.
  This is particularly the case when the imposed overidentifying restrictions are such that the unrestricted
  estimate is not close to satisfying them. Nevertheless, in most practical cases, the model is just identified
  and estimation is not required, and often reasonable overidentifying constraints are close to the unrestricted estimate.

  Employs the estimation function \code{optim} from the package \code{stats} that implements the optimization
  algorithms. See \code{?optim} for the documentation on the optimization methods.

  The arguments \code{B_pm_reg}, \code{B_perm}, and \code{B_signs} can be used to explore estimates based various orderings
  and sign changes of the columns of the impact matrices \eqn{B_m} of specific regimes. This can be useful in the presence
  of weak identification with respect to the ordering or signs of the columns \eqn{B_2,...,B_M} (see Virolainen 2025).

## These are long running examples that take approximately 1 minute to run.

## Estimate first a reduced form Gaussian STVAR p=3, M=2 model with the weighted relative
# stationary densities of the regimes as the transition weight function, and the means and
# AR matrices constrained to be identical across the regimes:
fit32cm <- fitSTVAR(gdpdef, p=3, M=2, AR_constraints=rbind(diag(3*2^2), diag(3*2^2)),
  weight_function="relative_dens", mean_constraints=list(1:2), parametrization="mean",
  nrounds=1, seeds=1, ncores=1)

# Then, we estimate/create various structural models based on the reduced form model.
# Create a structural model with the shocks identified recursively:
fit32cms_rec <- fitSSTVAR(fit32cm, identification="recursive")

# Create a structural model with the shocks identified by conditional heteroskedasticity:
fit32cms_hetsked <- fitSSTVAR(fit32cm, identification="heteroskedasticity")
fit32cms_hetsked # Print the estimates

# Estimate a structural model with the shocks identified by conditional heteroskedasticity
# and overidentifying constraints imposed on the impact matrix: positive diagonal element
# and zero upper right element:
fit32cms_hs2 <- fitSSTVAR(fit32cm, identification="heteroskedasticity",
 B_constraints=matrix(c(1, NA, 0, 1), nrow=2))

# Estimate a structural model with the shocks identified by conditional heteroskedasticity
# and overidentifying constraints imposed on the impact matrix: positive diagonal element
# and zero off-diagonal elements:
fit32cms_hs3 <- fitSSTVAR(fit32cms_hs2, identification="heteroskedasticity",
 B_constraints=matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow=2))

# Estimate first a reduced form two-regime Threshold VAR p=1 model with
# with independent skewed t shocks, and the first lag of the second variable
# as the switching variable, and AR matrices constrained to be identical
# across the regimes:
fit12c <- fitSTVAR(gdpdef, p=1, M=2, cond_dist="ind_skewed_t",
 AR_constraints=rbind(diag(1*2^2), diag(1*2^2)), weight_function="threshold",
 weightfun_pars=c(2, 1), nrounds=1, seeds=1, ncores=1)

# Due to the independent non-Gaussian shocks, the structural shocks are readily
# identified. The following returns the same model but marked as structural
# with the shocks identified by non-Gaussianity:
fit12c <- fitSSTVAR(fit12c)

# Estimate a model based on a reversed ordering of the columns of the impact matrix B_2:
fit12c2 <- fitSSTVAR(fit12c, B_pm_reg=2, B_perm=c(2, 1))

# Estimate a model based on reversed signs of the second column of B_2 and reversed
# ordering of the columns of B_2:
