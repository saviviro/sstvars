\arguments{

a univariate time series. Missing values are not supported.}

\item{weight_function}{What type of transition weights \eqn{\alpha_{m,t}} should be used?
\describe{
  \item{\code{"relative_dens"}:}{\eqn{\alpha_{m,t}=
    \frac{\alpha_mf_{m,dp}(y_{t-1},...,y_{t-p+1})}{\sum_{n=1}^M\alpha_nf_{n,dp}(y_{t-1},...,y_{t-p+1})}}, where
    \eqn{\alpha_m\in (0,1)} are weight parameters that satisfy \eqn{\sum_{m=1}^M\alpha_m=1} and
    \eqn{f_{m,dp}(\cdot)} is the \eqn{dp}-dimensional stationary density of the \eqn{m}th regime corresponding to \eqn{p}
    consecutive observations. Available for Gaussian conditional distribution only.}
  \item{\code{"logistic"}:}{\eqn{M=2}, \eqn{\alpha_{1,t}=1-\alpha_{2,t}},
    and \eqn{\alpha_{2,t}=[1+\exp\lbrace -\gamma(y_{it-j}-c) \rbrace]^{-1}}, where \eqn{y_{it-j}} is the lag \eqn{j}

    {\sum_{n=1}^M\exp\lbrace \gamma_n'z_{t-1} \rbrace}}, where \eqn{\gamma_m} are coefficient vectors, \eqn{\gamma_M=0},
    and \eqn{z_{t-1}} \eqn{(k\times 1)} is the vector containing a constant and the (lagged) switching variables.}
  \item{\code{"exponential"}:}{\eqn{M=2}, \eqn{\alpha_{1,t}=1-\alpha_{2,t}},
    and \eqn{\alpha_{2,t}=1-\exp\lbrace -\gamma(y_{it-j}-c) \rbrace}, where \eqn{y_{it-j}} is the lag \eqn{j}
    observation of the \eqn{i}th variable, \eqn{c} is a location parameter, and \eqn{\gamma > 0} is a scale parameter.}
  \item{\code{"threshold"}:}{\eqn{\alpha_{m,t} = 1} if \eqn{r_{m-1}<y_{it-j}\leq r_{m}} and \eqn{0} otherwise, where
     \eqn{-\infty\equiv r_0<r_1<\cdots <r_{M-1}<r_M\equiv\infty} are thresholds \eqn{y_{it-j}} is the lag \eqn{j}
     observation of the \eqn{i}th variable.}
  \item{\code{"exogenous"}:}{Exogenous nonrandom transition weights, specify the weight series in \code{weightfun_pars}.}
}
See the vignette for more details about the weight functions.}

\item{weightfun_pars}{\describe{
  \item{If \code{weight_function == "relative_dens"}:}{Not used.}
  \item{If \code{weight_function \%in\% c("logistic", "exponential", "threshold")}:}{a numeric vector with the switching variable
    \eqn{i\in\lbrace 1,...,d \rbrace} in the first and the lag \eqn{j\in\lbrace 1,...,p \rbrace} in the second element.}
  \item{If \code{weight_function == "mlogit"}:}{a list of two elements:
    \describe{
      \item{The first element \code{$vars}:}{a numeric vector containing the variables that should used as switching variables
        in the weight function in an increasing order, i.e., a vector with unique elements in \eqn{\lbrace 1,...,d \rbrace}.}
      \item{The second element \code{$lags}:}{an integer in \eqn{\lbrace 1,...,p \rbrace} specifying the number of lags to be
        used in the weight function.}
    }
  }
  \item{If \code{weight_function == "exogenous"}:}{a size (\code{nrow(data) - p} x \code{M}) matrix containing the exogenous
    transition weights as \code{[t, m]} for time \eqn{t} and regime \eqn{m}. Each row needs to sum to one and only weakly positive
    values are allowed.}
}}

\item{parametrization}{\code{"intercept"} or \code{"mean"} determining whether the model is parametrized with intercept
parameters \eqn{\phi_{m}} or regime means \eqn{\mu_{m}}, m=1,...,M.}

\item{identification}{is it reduced form model or an identified structural model; if the latter, how is it identified
(see the vignette or the references for details)?
\describe{
  \item{\code{"reduced_form"}:}{Reduced form model.}
  \item{\code{"recursive"}:}{The usual lower-triangular recursive identification of the shocks via their impact responses.}
  \item{\code{"heteroskedasticity"}:}{Identification by conditional heteroskedasticity, which imposes constant relative
    impact responses for each shock.}
  \item{\code{"non-Gaussianity"}:}{Identification by non-Gaussianity; requires mutually independent non-Gaussian shocks, thus,
    currently available only with the conditional distribution \code{"ind_Student"}.}
}}

\item{AR_constraints}{a size \eqn{(Mpd^2 \times q)} constraint matrix \eqn{C} specifying linear constraints
to the autoregressive parameters. The constraints are of the form
\eqn{(\varphi_{1},...,\varphi_{M}) = C\psi}, where \eqn{\varphi_{m} = (vec(A_{m,1}),...,vec(A_{m,p})) \ (pd^2 \times 1),\ m=1,...,M},
contains the coefficient matrices and \eqn{\psi} \eqn{(q \times 1)} contains the related parameters.
For example, to restrict the AR-parameters to be the identical across the regimes, set \eqn{C =}
[\code{I:...:I}]' \eqn{(Mpd^2 \times pd^2)} where \code{I = diag(p*d^2)}.}

\item{mean_constraints}{Restrict the mean parameters of some regimes to be identical? Provide a list of numeric vectors
such that each numeric vector contains the regimes that should share the common mean parameters. For instance, if
\code{M=3}, the argument \code{list(1, 2:3)} restricts the mean parameters of the second and third regime to be
identical but the first regime has freely estimated (unconditional) mean. Ignore or set to \code{NULL} if mean parameters
should not be restricted to be the same among any regimes. This constraint is available only for mean parametrized models;
that is, when \code{parametrization="mean"}.}

\item{weight_constraints}{a list of two elements, \eqn{R} in the first element and \eqn{r} in the second element,
specifying linear constraints on the transition weight parameters \eqn{\alpha}.
The constraints are of the form \eqn{\alpha = R\xi + r}, where \eqn{R} is a known \eqn{(a\times l)}
constraint matrix of full column rank (\eqn{a} is the dimension of \eqn{\alpha}), \eqn{r} is a known \eqn{(a\times 1)} constant,
and \eqn{\xi} is an unknown \eqn{(l\times 1)} parameter. \strong{Alternatively}, set \eqn{R=0} to constrain the
weight parameters to the constant \eqn{r} (in this case, \eqn{\alpha} is dropped from the constrained parameter vector).}

\item{B_constraints}{a \eqn{(d \times d)} matrix with its entries imposing constraints on the impact matrix \eqn{B_t}:
\code{NA} indicating that the element is unconstrained, a positive value indicating strict positive sign constraint,
a negative value indicating strict negative sign constraint, and zero indicating that the element is constrained to zero.
Currently only available for models with \code{identification="heteroskedasticity"} or \code{"non-Gaussianity"} due to the
(in)availability of appropriate parametrizations that allow such constraints to be imposed.}
