#' @title Calculate upper bound for the joint spectral radius of a set of matrices
#'
#' @description \code{bound_jsr_G} calculates lower and upper bounds for the joint spectral radious of a set of square matrices,
#'  typically the "bold A" matrices, using the algorithm by Gripenberg (1996).
#'
#' @param S the set of matrices the bounds should be calculated for in an array, in STVAR applications,
#'  all \eqn{((dp)x(dp))} "bold A" (companion form) matrices in a 3D array, so that \code{[, , m]} gives the matrix
#'  the regime \code{m}.
#' @param epsilon a strictly positive real number that approximately defines the goal of length of the interval between the lower
#'   and upper bounds. A smaller epsilon value results in a narrower interval, thus providing better accuracy for the bounds,
#'   but at the cost of increased computational effort. Note that the bounds are always wider than \code{epsilon} and it is not
#'   obvious what \code{epsilon} should be chosen obtain bounds of specific tightness.
#' @param adaptive_eps logical: if \code{TRUE}, starts with a large epsilon and then decreases it gradually whenever the progress
#'   of the algorithm requires, until the value given in the argument \code{epsilon} is reached. Usually speeds up the algorithm
#'   substantially but is an unconventional approach, and there is no guarantee that the algorithm converges appropriately towards
#'   bounds with the tightness given by the argument \code{epsilon}.
#' @param ncores the number of cores to be used in parallel computing.
#' @param print_progress logical: should the progress of the algorithm be printed?
#' @details The upper and lower bounds are calculated using the Gripenberg's (1996) branch-and-bound method, which is also discussed
#'  in Chang and Blondel (2013). This function can be generally used for approximating the JSR of a set of square matrices, but the
#'  main intention is STVAR applications (for models created with \code{sstvars}, the function \code{bound_JSR} should be preferred).
#'  Specifically, Kheifets and Saikkonen (2020) show that if the joint spectral radius of the companion form AR matrices of the regimes
#'  is smaller than one, the STVAR process is ergodic stationary. Virolainen (2025) shows the same result for his parametrization of
#'  of threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models. Therefore, if the upper bound is smaller than one, the process is
#'  stationary ergodic. However, as the condition is not necessary but sufficient and also because the bound might be too conservative,
#'  upper bound larger than one does not imply that the process is not ergodic stationary. You can try higher accuracy, and if the bound
#'  is still larger than one, the result does not tell whether the process is ergodic stationary or not.
#'
#'  Note that with high precision (small \code{epsilon}), the computational effort required are substantial and
#'  the estimation may take long, even though the function takes use of parallel computing. This is because
#'  with small epsilon the the number of candidate solutions in each iteration may grow exponentially and a large
#'  number of iterations may be required. For this reason, \code{adaptive_eps=TRUE} can be considered for large matrices,
#'  in which case the algorithm starts with a large epsilon, and then decreases it when new candidate solutions are
#'  not found, until the epsilon given by the argument \code{epsilon} is reached.
#' @return Returns an upper bound for the joint spectral radius of the "companion form AR matrices" of the regimes.

#' @title Calculate upper bound for the joint spectral radius of the "companion form AR matrices" of the regimes
#'
#' @description \code{bound_JSR} calculates an bounds for the joint spectral radius of the
#'  "companion form AR matrices" matrices of the regimes to assess the validity of the stationarity condition.
#'
#' @inheritParams diagnostic_plot
#' @inheritParams bound_jsr_G
#' @details A sufficient condition for ergodic stationarity of the STVAR processes implemented in \code{sstvars} is that the joint
#'  spectral radius of the "companion form AR matrices" of the regimes is smaller than one (Kheifets and Saikkonen, 2020).
#'  This function calculates an upper (and lower) bound for the JSR and is implemented to assess the validity of this condition
#'  in practice. If the bound is smaller than one, the model is deemed ergodic stationary.
#'
#'  Implements the branch-and-bound method by Gripenberg (1996) in the conventional form (\code{adaptive_eps=FALSE}) and in a form
#'  incorporating "adaptive tightness" (\code{adaptive_eps=FALSE}). The latter approach is unconventional and does not guarantee
#'  appropriate convergence of the bounds close to the desired tightness given in the argument \code{epsilon}, but it usually
#'  substantially speeds up the algorithm. When \code{print_progress==TRUE}, the tightest bounds found so-far are printed in each
#'  iteration of the algorithm, so you can also just terminate the algorithm when the bounds are tight enough for your purposes.
#'  Consider also adjusting the argument \code{epsilon}, in particular when \code{adaptive_eps=FALSE}, as larger epsilon does not
#'  just make the bounds less tight but also speeds up the algorithm significantly. See Chang and Blondel (2013) for a discussion
#'  on variuous methods for bounding the JSR.
#' @return Returns lower and upper bounds for the joint spectral radius of the "companion form AR matrices" of the regimes.

#' # Since the largest modulus of the companion form AR matrices is not very close
#' # to one, we likely won't need very thight bounds to verify the JSR is smaller
#' # than one. Thus, using a small epsilon would make the algorithm unnecessarily slow,
#' # so we use the (still quite small) epsilon=0.01:
#' bound_JSR(mod122, epsilon=0.01, adaptive_eps=FALSE)
#' # The upper bound is smaller than one, so the model is ergodic stationary.
#'
#' # If we want tighter bounds, we can set smaller epsilon, e.g., epsilon=0.001:
#' bound_JSR(mod122, epsilon=0.001, adaptive_eps=FALSE)
#'
#' # Using adaptive_eps=TRUE usually speeds up the algorithm when the model
#' # is large, but with the small model here, the speed-difference is small:
#' bound_JSR(mod122, epsilon=0.001, adaptive_eps=TRUE)
